# About Nqabenhle Mlaba

## Introduction

 I am a [WeThinkCode__](https://wethinkcode.co.za) student with over three years of coding experience. I build web apps and development tools, and I've been diving into neural networks. I'm currently in the top 3.253% of CodeWars warriors. I love solving problems, experimenting with ideas, and pushing my skills forward.

## Values, Principles, and Beliefs

- Understand how the tools you use work under the hood.
- Learn by building.
- Focus = commitment; shiny object syndrome is false progress.
